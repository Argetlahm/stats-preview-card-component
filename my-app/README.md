## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework


### What I learned

First time I tried to integrate a React development environment into the project. I use Create React App module for this project. I also learned how to modify and edit the CSS and use the public folder from within the project.

Finally, I also learn some new knowledge about how to host the React project on Github for simpple previewing.

### Continued development

Perhaps I will update this project in the future to modify some of the responsiveness issue that may be found in the future
